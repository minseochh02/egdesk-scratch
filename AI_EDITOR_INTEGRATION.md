# AI Editor Integration

The AI Editor has been transformed from a standalone upload-style interface to an integrated sidebar within the CodeEditor, providing AI-powered code editing capabilities with codespace vectorization.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Code Editing
- **Integrated Sidebar**: AI Editor now appears as a collapsible sidebar in the CodeEditor
- **Real-time Context**: Automatically analyzes the current file and provides relevant context
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, and custom endpoints
- **Smart Edits**: AI generates precise code edits with confidence scores and explanations

### ðŸ§  Codespace Vectorization
- **Workspace Analysis**: Automatically scans and analyzes the entire codespace
- **Semantic Search**: Finds related files and dependencies based on content and structure
- **Context Enhancement**: Provides AI with broader context including:
  - Import relationships
  - Class and function dependencies
  - Variable usage patterns
  - Related file contexts

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Context Integration
- **File Analysis**: Extracts imports, classes, functions, and variables from code
- **Language Support**: Supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and more
- **Dependency Mapping**: Builds relationship graphs between files
- **Search Indexing**: Creates searchable index of code patterns and structures

## Usage

### 1. Open CodeEditor
Navigate to the CodeEditor tab in the main application.

### 2. Toggle AI Editor
Click the ðŸ¤– button in the toolbar to open/close the AI Editor sidebar.

### 3. Select a File
Open any code file in the editor. The AI Editor will automatically analyze it.

### 4. Configure AI Settings
- Select your API key and provider
- Choose the AI model
- Adjust temperature and token limits
- Customize the system prompt

### 5. Request Edits
Type your editing instructions in natural language:
- "Add error handling to the main function"
- "Refactor this class to use async/await"
- "Fix the import statement"
- "Add JSDoc comments"

### 6. Review and Apply
- Preview the proposed changes
- Review AI explanations
- Apply edits with one click
- Edits are automatically saved

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- **AIEditor**: Sidebar component integrated into CodeEditor
- **CodespaceVectorService**: Analyzes and indexes the entire workspace
- **AIEditorService**: Handles AI API communication and edit processing

### Services
- **File Analysis**: Language-specific code parsing and context extraction
- **Vectorization**: Semantic indexing and search capabilities
- **Context Enhancement**: Intelligent context building for AI prompts

### Integration Points
- **CodeEditor**: Main editor with AI sidebar integration
- **File System**: Workspace scanning and file reading
- **AI APIs**: Multi-provider support for different AI services

## Supported Languages

- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Full support with ES6+ features
- **Python**: Import analysis, class/function extraction
- **Java**: Package structure, method analysis
- **C++**: Header analysis, class extraction
- **Other**: Basic text analysis for unsupported languages

## Configuration

### AI Provider Settings
```typescript
{
  provider: 'openai', // openai, anthropic, google, azure, custom
  model: 'gpt-4', // Provider-specific model
  temperature: 0.3, // Creativity level (0-2)
  maxTokens: 2000, // Response length limit
  systemPrompt: 'Custom AI behavior instructions'
}
```

### Context Options
- **Include Context**: Enable/disable codespace context
- **Require Confirmation**: Manual approval before applying edits
- **Auto-apply**: Direct application of AI suggestions

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: No need to switch between applications
2. **Rich Context**: AI understands your entire codebase
3. **Precise Edits**: Character-level accuracy with confidence scoring
4. **Workflow Efficiency**: Edit, review, and apply in one interface
5. **Learning**: AI learns from your codebase patterns and style

## Future Enhancements

- **Batch Operations**: Apply AI edits across multiple files
- **Code Review**: AI-powered code review suggestions
- **Refactoring Tools**: Automated code refactoring assistance
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate documentation from code
- **Testing**: Generate test cases based on code analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Errors**: Ensure your AI provider API key is valid
2. **Context Loading**: Large workspaces may take time to analyze
3. **Edit Failures**: Check AI response format and try regenerating
4. **Performance**: Disable context inclusion for very large files

### Best Practices
1. **Clear Instructions**: Be specific about what you want to change
2. **Review Edits**: Always preview changes before applying
3. **Backup Files**: Keep backups before making major AI edits
4. **Iterative Approach**: Make small changes and refine as needed

## Examples

### Adding Error Handling
```
Instruction: "Add try-catch error handling to the main function"
Result: AI adds appropriate error handling with logging
```

### Refactoring Code
```
Instruction: "Convert this callback-based function to use async/await"
Result: AI refactors the function and updates all callers
```

### Code Documentation
```
Instruction: "Add JSDoc comments to all public functions"
Result: AI adds comprehensive documentation to functions
```

The AI Editor integration transforms your CodeEditor into a powerful AI-assisted development environment, combining the best of traditional code editing with cutting-edge AI capabilities.
