## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No 'egdesk' API key found"**
   - Make sure you have configured a Google/Gemini API key with the exact name "egdesk"
   - Check that the API key is active and has the correct permissions

2. **"Failed to generate dog image"**
   - Verify your Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try a simpler image prompt

3. **"Failed to paste image"**
   - Ensure the image was successfully generated and copied to clipboard
   - Check that the blog editor is ready to receive paste operations
   - Try running on macOS (clipboard functionality is macOS-specific)

4. **"Automation failed"**
   - Verify your Naver credentials are correct
   - Check that Chrome is installed (or the system will use Chromium)
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection

### Debug Information

The system provides detailed logging:
- Check the console for detailed debug information
- Look for messages starting with `[DEBUG]`
- Image generation status is logged
- Automation steps are logged with timestamps

## 📁 File Structure

The debug functionality uses these key files:

```
src/main/
├── main.ts                           # Debug handler registration
